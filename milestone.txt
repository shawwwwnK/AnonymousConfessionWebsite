CS193X Final Project Milestone
==============================

Project Title: An Anonymous Confession Website
Your Name: Shawn Kang
Your SUNetID: kangzx

Overview
--------
I have finished the static frontend (HTML and CSS layout and styling). I will need to start backend soon.

Project Changes
---------------
I don't have plans to change my project from my proposal.

Implementation Details
----------------------
I have implemented the frontend with the header (with website name and login buttons), filter panel (with order buttons
and ranking of keywords and emotions which will be added dynamically in JS), feed panel (with a template confession post
and a post form), and a comments panel (with a comment form and template comment).
For backend, it will be similar to project 3 while there will be more processing after a POST action (for the backend to
extract keywords). There will also be more GET APIs to achieve the filtering.

External libraries and code
---------------------------
I'll try to use an NLP package to do sentiment analysis, such as TextBlob or Pattern. They are python libraries.

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
I consulted assignment 2 and 3 starter CSS and HTML and code.

Anything else?
--------------
Not at the moment.
